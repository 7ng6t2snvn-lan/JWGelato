PRODUCTION PROCESS
================================================================================

MISE EN PLACE:
□ Scale all ingredients precisely
□ Boiron blood orange purée should be COLD (4°C)
□ Have high-shear blender ready (immersion or Vitamix)
□ Prepare aging container with lid

STEP 1: DRY BLEND STABILIZERS
□ Combine in small bowl:
  - Tara gum (full amount)
  - Guar gum (full amount)  
  - Kappa carrageenan (full amount)
  - 100g of the sucrose
□ Whisk thoroughly to prevent clumping

STEP 2: HEAT WATER
□ Heat water to 40-45°C (warm to touch, not hot)
□ Transfer to mixing container

STEP 3: HYDRATE STABILIZERS
□ While whisking vigorously, slowly stream in stabilizer/sugar blend
□ Continue whisking for 2 minutes
□ Ensure no lumps remain

STEP 4: ADD REMAINING SUGARS
□ Add remaining sucrose - whisk until dissolved
□ Add dextrose - whisk until dissolved
□ Add glucose powder DE42 - whisk until dissolved
□ Base should be clear/translucent

STEP 5: ADD INULIN
□ While blending with HIGH SHEAR, slowly add inulin
□ Continue high-shear blending for 2-3 minutes
□ Inulin MUST be fully hydrated (no graininess)
□ Base will become slightly viscous

STEP 6: ADD BLOOD ORANGE PURÉE
□ Add COLD Boiron blood orange purée
□ DO NOT HEAT - keep raw for bright citrus aromatics
□ Blend smooth (30-60 seconds)
□ Mixture will be vibrant orange-red

STEP 7: STRAIN & CHECK
□ Strain through fine chinois if any lumps remain
□ Taste for balance (should be rich, not cloying)
□ Check temperature (should be 10-15°C)

STEP 8: AGE
□ Transfer to covered container
□ Refrigerate at 4°C for 4-12 hours
□ Overnight aging is ideal
□ This allows full hydration of stabilizers and inulin

STEP 9: CHURN
□ Stir base before churning
□ Churn according to your machine specifications
□ Target overrun: 25-35% (dense, rich texture)
□ Churn until -5°C to -7°C

STEP 10: BLAST FREEZE & STORE
□ Transfer to storage containers
□ Blast freeze to -18°C
□ Store at -18°C to -20°C
□ Serve at -12°C to -14°C for optimal texture

CRITICAL NOTES
================================================================================

DO NOT COOK THE CITRUS:
Blood orange's volatile aromatics (limonene, anthocyanins) are destroyed by 
heat. The whole point of this sorbet is the bright, fresh blood orange character
with those distinctive berry undertones. Keep it raw.

INULIN HYDRATION:
The 95g of inulin (2.4% of batch) is what gives this sorbet its creamy, almost
gelato-like mouthfeel. It MUST be fully dissolved with high-shear blending or
you'll get a gritty texture. If you don't have a high-shear blender, increase
aging time to 24 hours and blend again before churning.

STABILIZER BALANCE:
The Tara+Guar+Kappa blend provides:
- Tara: body and heat stability
- Guar: prevents ice crystal growth
- Kappa: clean mouthfeel without gumminess
This specific ratio has been tested extensively.

SERVING TEMPERATURE:
This sorbet MUST be served at -12°C to -14°C. Too cold (-18°C) and it's rock
hard. Too warm (-8°C) and it melts too fast. Use a dipping cabinet or temper
pans 15 minutes before service.

FLAVOR NOTES & PAIRINGS
================================================================================

PRIMARY FLAVOR: Deep blood orange with natural berry/raspberry undertones from
anthocyanins. Not as acidic as regular orange, with a more complex, wine-like
character.

TEXTURE: Luxurious and creamy from high inulin content. Almost gelato-like
mouthfeel despite being dairy-free.

SWEETNESS LEVEL: Rich and dessert-forward (30% sugar) but not cloying. The
glucose powder provides body without excessive sweetness.

PAIRS WELL WITH:
- Dark chocolate (70%+)
- Almond or hazelnut biscotti
- Olive oil cake
- Vanilla panna cotta
- Prosecco or sparkling wine

SEASONAL NOTES:
Blood orange season is December-March. Peak flavor is January-February. The
Boiron purée maintains quality year-round but fresh blood orange supremes as
garnish during season really elevate the presentation.

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Grainy texture
SOLUTION: Inulin not fully hydrated. Increase high-shear blending time or
extend aging to 24 hours.

PROBLEM: Too hard to scoop
SOLUTION: Either freezer is too cold or serving temperature too low. Temper
at room temp for 10-15 minutes or check display case temp.

PROBLEM: Melts too quickly
SOLUTION: Base was under-churned or stabilizers weren't fully hydrated. 
Ensure proper aging time.

PROBLEM: Lacks blood orange flavor
SOLUTION: Check purée quality/age. Should be vibrant orange-red, not brown.
Also ensure you didn't heat the base above 45°C.

PROBLEM: Too sweet
SOLUTION: This is a rich formula. Consider reducing sucrose by 50g and
increasing water by 50g for a lighter version.
